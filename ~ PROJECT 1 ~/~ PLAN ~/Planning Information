The plan for this project was done on Microsoft Project, with 6 employees each with their own skillsets and costs,
pre-development implementation and different tasks with estimated hours for completetion to be done by a set employee, making
sure no one is over-resourced.
.
Within this folder, there will be screenshots of the employees and the timeline.
